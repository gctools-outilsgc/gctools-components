    <h2>Article Recommendation Micro-service</h2>
    <p>
      Article recommendations depend on 3 factors such as user profiles,
      article content and the context where the recommendations are required.
    </p>
    <p>
      The contexts are given by the location of a user during her/his
      exploration of the GCpedia website (home/landing page, article page or
      group discussion page) and the status of the user (logged on or off).
      Thus there are 6 possible contexts in total consisting of all
      combinations of the aforementioned options.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following example not only tests every context the article
      recommendation service supports, it also provides a friendly interface
      to chose contexts, users, articles and group discussions.  Using this
      interface allows you to see how the service will respond in predicatable
      situations without embedding it first.
    </p>
